Nowadays, it becomes a heatedly debated topic whether a student should be required to attend　classes or not. Some people hold the opinion that the university students should be required to go　to classes. However, others have a negative attitude. If I were forced to agree with one of the two　positions, I would stand behind the latter. My Arguments for this point are listed as follows.

　　I agree with the statement that going to classes should be optional for university students without　reservation since I believe a student is supposed to attend those classes he or she is interested in.

　　Naturally, interest is the mother of study. When attracted by a wonderful class, you will attend it　unforcedly and immediately. Nevertheless, not all classes are so popular in reality and no one has　interest in every class. Consequently, you should select the classes you like to attend for a higher　efficiency of studying. It can be given a good example, in current universities, many excellent　students almost have the record of skipping some boring and undesirable classes.

　　Another reason that can be seen by every one is that it contributes to build a university student's　ability of learning by himself or herself. Obviously, by choosing good and meaningful classes,　giving up those undesirable, or studying these classes you can not attend somehow by yourself,　you will learn how to distribute your study time and acquire the capability of learning by yourself,　which is tremendously important to modern university students. Many celebrities, such as Bill　Gates, have such powerful ability by not attending some classes when they were in university.

　　Admittedly, being required to attend classes has advantages of disciplining the student, however,　considering most university students can discipline themselves on their own, I believe it is　sagacious to agree with that going to classes should be optional for college or university students.
